    <h3>Analysis of Existing Solutions</h3>
    <h4 class="mt-4">Brief Analysis of Current Tools</h4>
    <p>
      There are a handful are a large number of learning management systems
      (LMS) and video chat options available, but only a handful are useable at
      large universities like UGA. However, none of these systems are an
      all-encompassing solution to bridge the in-person vs. remote experience
      gap.

    <h4 class="mt-4">Potential Guidelines and Solutions</h4>
    <p>
      Accessibility is a priority for these platforms, as making sure all groups
      of students and faculty have easy access to the same information allows
      the platform to be universally usable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning management systems must streamline common action sequences (i.e.
      accessing assignments and grades, uploading documents to dropboxes,
      receiving announcements), so that the time to learn is as short as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Error prevention and ample feedback are very important as they prevent
      confusion amid actions or mistakes (i.e. submitting an exam or assignment,
      displaying confirmation receipt when a time-sensitive discussion board is
      made public).
    </p>

      All three of the above principles and guidelines would bolster the user
      experience of our project.
