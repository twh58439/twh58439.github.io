          Student engagement in Hybrid Synchronous classes is poor, and both
          student-student and student-teacher interaction needs improvement.

          acknowledges these problems with online learning, and specifically
          recommends Teachers use Zoom's interative tools to improve student
          engagement. They focus on using Zoom's chat and other non-verbal
          feedback tools, such as polling and emoji reactions, but anyone who
          has used these features know they are not up to the standard that
          should be required for an online learning platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a video chat platform, it makes sense that Zoom's non-verbal
          feedback systems take a backseat to interacting over video. However,
          this is hugely problematic for Hybrid Synchronous instruction.
          Student-student interaction is forced to rely on students willingly
          engaging with each other over chat, which requires students noticing
          an ongoing discussion in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, simply asking a question to the professor requires the
          student either hope the professor notices they have raised a question
          (or used the "raise hand" feature to indicate they have a question),
          or interrupt the professor to ensure they are heard. The polling
          interface is also rudementary and is not a 1:1 replacement for a true
          quizzing system like <a href="https://kahoot.com/">Kahoot</a>, and
          requries students willingly engage with the question. The teacher must
          manually check who answered the poll, if they wish to enforce student
          poll engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these systems also suffer from a lack of integration with a
          learning platform like Moodle or ELC, and any data from polls or
          discussion is lost as soon as the zoom meeting ends, further
          diminishing the student's ability to get feedback from a Hybrid
          Synchronous format.

          Instructors and students are the obvious users of this technology.
          However, improving person-person interactions will aid all potential
          users who utilize similar hybrid meeting formats.
