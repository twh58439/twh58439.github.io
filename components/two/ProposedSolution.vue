        <p>
          Currently, courses are limited to the functions of the platforms they
          are on (i.e. Zoom not being built for an education environment and
          TopHat having a relatively large lead time), so the creativity of
          educators has been bottlenecked.
        </p>
        <p>
          By having a specialized platform built to serve both remote and
          in-person students, educators can focus on their curriculum while also
          maintaining a consistent experience across both modes of learning. For
          example, our project would improve Zoom's relatively lackluster
          non-video engagement systems where chat messages are often unseen and
          nothing is persisted between classes. In doing so, students may
          receive immediate and accessible feedback for the interactions they
          made during the lecture and the gap between those attending in-person
          and remotely may shrink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, improving the quizzing system will bolster engagement
          with those attending remotely, allowing remote students to better
          focus on the lecture contents. On the other hand, the professor can
          also receive immediate feedback from students instead of speaking to
          what is essentially a void of black rectangles.

            Increased participation from students on both modes of learning
            compared to already existing solutions. One way to measure this
            would be to log the various interactions the students engage in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anonymous student polling to determine their satisfaction with the
            usability of the platform compared to products like Zoom and
            Blackboard Learn.
