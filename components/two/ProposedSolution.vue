    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, courses are limited to the functions of the platforms they are
      on (i.e. Zoom not being built for an education environment and TopHat
      having a relatively large lead time), so the creativity of educators has
      been bottlenecked.
    </p>
    <p>
      By having a specialized platform built to serve both remote and in-person
      students, educators can focus on their curriculum while also maintaining a
      consistent experience across both modes of learning. For example, our
      project would improve Zoom's relatively lackluster non-video engagement
      systems where chat messages are often unseen and nothing is persisted
      between classes. In doing so, students may receive immediate and
      accessible feedback for the interactions they made during the lecture and
      the gap between those attending in-person and remotely may shrink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, improving the quizzing system will bolster engagement with
      those attending remotely, allowing remote students to better focus on the
      lecture contents. On the other hand, the professor can also receive
      immediate feedback from students instead of speaking to what is
      essentially a void of black rectangles.
    </p>
    <h4>Measuring Success</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Increased participation from students on both modes of learning compared
        to already existing solutions. One way to measure this would be to log
        the various interactions the students engage in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anonymous student polling to determine their satisfaction with the
        usability of the platform compared to products like Zoom and Blackboard
        Learn.
      </li>
    </ul>
