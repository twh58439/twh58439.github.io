      Improving Hybrid Synchronous learning by improving software to increase
      student-student and teacher-student engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online learning has steadily risen over the past decade, and as of
      December of 2019, both syncronous and asynchronous online learning
      platforms such as Udacity and Coursera are projected to reach a market
      value of
      <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y698ny54" target="_blank">$350 billion</a>
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Covid-19 created a new instructional format, known by the
      University of Georgia as Hybrid Synchronous Instruction, which faces
      different challenges than purely online learning.

          Hybrid Synchronous Instructional Format

      </h5>
      <p>
        A certain number of students (as determined by the classroom capacity)
        join the instructor on a rotating basis for socially-distanced,
        face-to-face instruction during each class session, with remaining
        students primarily joining synchronously through Zoom (or some other
        secure platform) during assigned class hours. The class will meet at the
        regularly scheduled days/times with some students attending in-person on
        campus and some students attending via Zoom or remotely.

    <p>
      These Hybrid Synchronous classrooms rely on a combination of tools like
      Zoom to allow students and teachers to interact with one another, and
      learning platforms like Moodle or Blackboard to organize course content.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, juggling multiple platforms creates disorganization and do not
      integrate with the zoom "classroom". Zoom and other video-chat platforms
      perform that job well but fall well short of a classroom environment when
      it comes to asking questions, discussing topics, getting the teacher's
      attention, and other forms of teacher-student or student-student
      interactions.

      The Senior Googlers aim to eliminate the difference between in-person and
      online students and create the same learning experience independent of
      location by improving the interaction systems of Zoom, and integrating
      them with the organizational and feedback-driven systems of learning
      platforms like Moodle or ELC.
