          Improving <b>Hybrid Synchronous</b> learning by improving software to

          Online learning has steadily risen over the past decade, and as of
          December of 2019, both syncronous and asynchronous online learning
          platforms such as Udacity and Coursera are projected to reach a market
          value of

          However, Covid-19 created a new instructional format, known by the
          University of Georgia as Hybrid Synchronous Instruction, which faces
          different challenges than purely online learning.

              <p>
                A certain number of students (as determined by the classroom
                capacity) join the instructor on a rotating basis for
                socially-distanced, face-to-face instruction during each class
                session, with remaining students primarily joining synchronously
                through Zoom (or some other secure platform) during assigned
                class hours. The class will meet at the regularly scheduled
                days/times with some students attending in-person on campus and
                some students attending via Zoom or remotely.

        <p>
          These Hybrid Synchronous classrooms rely on a combination of tools
          like Zoom to allow students and teachers to interact with one another,
          and learning platforms like Moodle or Blackboard to organize course
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, juggling multiple platforms creates disorganization and do
          not integrate with the zoom "classroom". Zoom and other video-chat
          platforms perform that job well but fall well short of a classroom
          environment when it comes to asking questions, discussing topics,
          getting the teacher's attention, and other forms of teacher-student or
          student-student interactions.

          The Senior Googlers aim to eliminate the difference between in-person
          and online students and create the same learning experience
          independent of location by improving the interaction systems of Zoom,
          and integrating them with the organizational and feedback-driven
          systems of learning platforms like Moodle or ELC.
