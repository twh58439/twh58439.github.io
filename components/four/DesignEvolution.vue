      As a group, we discussed the user stores and decided to wireframe what we
      considered the most important: student engagement, student questions, and
      the quizzing system. Next, we split into 3 teams, with each pair creating
      a rough wireframe with no design standards in mind. Finally, we met back
      up as a group to review each design and any additions, changes, or
      removals, before deciding on a unifying theme and moving to the mockup
      stage.

    <h6>Mockup</h6>
    <p class="mt-2">
      We decided on using the Microsoft Teams UI as we linked the simple but
      clean design and it generally contained most elements we would need to
      create our new learning platform. As a group, we worked on one figma
      canvas and worked the wireframe for each user story as a group, with each
      pair giving most of their attention to their user story. Once satisfied,
      we began to create our prototype.
    </p>
    <h6>Prototype</h6>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Like the mockup, each pair was first responsible for creating the
      interactions specific to their user story. Next, the group as a whole
      created necessary common screens that link frames, and created and tested
      the more general interactions (such as shared navigation elements).
