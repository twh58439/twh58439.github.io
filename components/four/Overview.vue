        In the wake of COVID, education systems across the globe have had to
        shift learning formats entirely
      </li>
      <li>
        While there are plenty of learning management systems in market right
        now, we concluded that there is no singular platform capable of catering
        to the wide spectrum of student and professor needs
      </li>
      <li>
        Our goal is to eliminate the differences in learning experience between
        in-person and online students and create the same learning experience
        independent of location
