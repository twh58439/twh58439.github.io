    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <h6>Research Question</h6>
    <p class="font-italic blockquote-header">
      Does our solution reduce the gap between the learning experience of
      in-person/remote students and interactions with the instructor?
    </p>
    <h6>Methodology</h6>
    <p class="">
      We will utilize surveys as they provide a good look into the impressions
      of the design from the user base. Experiments that observe the time it
      takes to complete certain user stories (i.e. going to the gradebook for a
      certain class) versus other learning management systems can also provide
      valuable insight into how our solution stacks up against the competition.
      After each session, the users can then be interviewed to gauge their
      impressions of the application in part or as a whole.
    </p>
    <h6>Testing Procedures</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We will be sure to let our participants know what data we are collecting
        and for what purpose. Importantly, we will make clear (especially to the
        experimental group) that the results of their answers or performance
        have no impact on their current standing in any class.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is nothing about our project that needs to be concealed from our
        participants, so we will be able to answer all questions the participant
        may have, and will communicate this to the participants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Participation is voluntary, data is anonymous, and we will make this
        clear to our participants, emphasizing their role in future decision
        making.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once all the information is reviewed and questions have been asked,
        participants who are willing to participate in the study will sign a
        form stating as such.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will make sure that the participants know that they can leave at any
        time and can refuse to answer any questions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h6>Data Collection & Organization</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Instructor response time to in-person engagement/online students</li>
      <li>
        Use of discussion queue (time devoted by instructor and student
        participation)
      </li>
      <li>Time to access and complete quizzing/assignment vs secondary app</li>
      <li>Percentage of responses missed from remote students</li>
      <li>
        The data will be organized with bar graphs to represent the difference
        of our prototype vs control
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Analysis of Data</h6>
    <p>
      As many online students struggle to have their questions answered in a
      timely manner, in stark contrast to that of in-person attendance, the
      instructor’s time to respond to questions and/or comments will be used as
      a measure of consistency between the in-person and remote students’
      learning experience. Additionally, interactions between the students and
      instructor are paramount to having students properly understand the course
      content, so measuring how many questions/comments are missed by the
      instructor before, during, and after lectures will provide ample insight
      into the effectiveness of our solution and its competitors in bridging the
      gap between in-person and remote attendance.
    </p>
    <h6>Covid-19 Precautions</h6>
    <p>
      All surveying, experimentation, and interviewing will occur remotely, so
      there should be little to no increased risk of infection. Additionally,
      collaboration between the testing and design team can take place in a
      remote environment.
