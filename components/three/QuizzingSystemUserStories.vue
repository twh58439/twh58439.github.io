    <h3>Quizzing System: User Stories</h3>
    <p class="font-italic blockquote-header">
      "As a student, I want a quizzing system that makes me feel like I actually
      should be engaged in the course material rather than the traditional
      “attendance polls."
    </p>
    <p class="font-italic blockquote-header">
      "As an instructor, I want a better quizzing system so that I may discern
      the current state of my student’s learning journey, regardless if they’re
      remote or in-person."

      Quizzes - both formal graded quizzes and question-response actions in the
      instructor are vital to gauging a student's mastery of the material, as
      well as give the instructor feedback on their effectivess. Learning
      platforms like ELC are fine for formal quizzes, but if the instructor
      simply wants to ask a few questions, it is not practical to expect the
      students to switch over, answer a few small questions, then switch back to
      their learning material.

      Zoom has a "polling" system, but while it allows students to select
      answers, it simply gives the percent-answer spread over the answers and
      not which is correct. It also requires teachers to create polls on the
      fly, and any long-term tracking of quiz performance is lost unless
      manually tracked. We aim to improve the ability for hybrid-synchronous
      students actively engage with the material, while also improving the
      instructors ability to create quizzes and associate them with the
      material.
