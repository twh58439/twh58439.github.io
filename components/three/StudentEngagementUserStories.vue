    <h3>Student Engagement: User Stories</h3>
    <p class="font-italic blockquote-header">
      "As a student, I want to have access to feedback and lecture content that
      persists across lectures and sessions so that i can have a reference to
      bolster my learning experience."

    <p class="font-italic blockquote-header">
      "As an instructor, I want to receive immediate feedback about student
      engagement that persists across lectures and sessions so that I can gauge
      the interactivity of my content."

      As discussed in milestone one, poor active student engagement in online
      classes is a huge problem for online classes. Our group sought to unify
      the engagement experience of both online and in-person classes by
      providing functionality that benefits both groups and improve the
      classroom experience no matter where the student is.

      Online classroom tools like ELC were used at UGA before the rise of
      hybrid-synchronous learning, and the marketshare of similar online
      learning platforms like Moodle suggest they will only see increased use in
      the future. However, the location of interactions between instructors and
      students seem fractured and lack a convenient central location for all.
      ELC has mediocre forum posts, and works well for quizzes and tracking
      grades, but lacks live communication. Piazza is an effective forum-type
      discussion tool, but is a separate tool from ELC. Zoom is an effective
      live-communication tool, but chat and other forms of non-verbal feedback
      are secondary and non-persistent. Even in a class focused on
      Human-Computer Interaction, the lack of a unified tool necessitates
      students using all 3 platforms for their specialized purposes. We aim to
      combine the best features of each into a tool that will benefit
      traditional, remote, and hybrid-synchronous learning.

    <h4>Functional Goals</h4>
    <b-row class="mt-3">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep a history of chat and other interactions that can be accessed by
          students and can be selectively released by the instructor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a universal gradebook that is easily accessible and provides
          near-instantaneous feedback on correct answers and good discussion
          posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a grid system for the lecture content, sort of like a file
          explorer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to upload and create form-fillable PDFs for instructors to use
          so that students can complete printable assignments without having to
          print them out.
        </li>
      </ul>
